# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems.
Importance of software engineering in technology industry involves creation of software applications and systems.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Milestones of system engineering:
(1) The development of programming languages e.g python
(2) The advent of structured programming in the '70s
(3) The rise of AGILE methodologies in the 2000s
(4) The establishment of software engineering discipline in the '60s
(5) The advent of Operating systems

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Requirements: This involves thr gathering and docukenting user needs and system requirements 
2. Design: This entails creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface 
3. Implementation: It depicts writing codes and building thr software according to the design specifications 
4. Testing: This invovles conductimg various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements 
5. Deployment:  This involves releasing the software to users or customers 
6. Maintenance: It entails providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

 The Waterfall methodology is a linear sequential approach to software development, where each phase must be completed before the next begins. It follows a rigid structure, often likened to a waterfall flowing from one stage to the next.. Suitable scenarios for the Waterfall methodology include well-defined requirements projects, small-scale projects, project with strict deadlines etc. 
The Agile methodology is a flexible approach to software development that emphasizes iterative development, customer collaboration, and continuous improvement. It promotes principles such as responding to change, customer collaboration, and delivering working software frequently. Suitable scenarios for Agile methodology include evolving projects, large-scale projects, projects with early delivery time, Top quality and satisfaction projects.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
